#' @title Run IAO Reader App

#' @description This function is responsible for starting the core application
#'  of this package. The application itself is located inside the
#'  \code{iaoreader} package files.
#'
#' @param port a port on which the Shiny application will be hosted.
#' @param run_app when \code{FALSE} the app object is returned and the
#'  application is not started. This is mainly used for deployment of the
#'  Shiny application to services such as \url{https://www.shinyapps.io/}.

    #       the application due to the Shiny creating its own namespace.

    #       available within the application.
