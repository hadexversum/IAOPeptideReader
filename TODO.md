 - Add an information that rows corresponding to incorrect input files have error messages displayed on mouseover (or change the way those messages are shown).
 - Add button with URL to the repo to the app.
 - Add titlePanel (with better CSS than the default `titlePanel` has).
 - Create the JS plot.
    - During the plot creation create new inputs in the **Plot Settings** tab for each feature which should be customizable.
    - Add div for the plot.
    - Create canvas.
    - Ensure that the plot behaves *correctly* when the browser window is resized.
 - Test interrupting file upload when too many files were selected.
 - Make the summary table detachable or relocate it so that it can be viewed alongside the plot.
 - Add `shinycssloaders`.
 - Fixes:
    - Update `selectInput` in the **Data Preview** tab to work better when there is a file with a long name and the resolution is low (browser is resized).
    - Fix the infinitely stacking observers created by `input_summary_row_server` (maybe creating custom domain and shutting it down?). For the deletion observers only the not used ones persist and all the regular observers persist.
 - Nice to haves:
    - Confirmation when resetting the plot settings.
    - Option to disable the reset confirmation for current session.
    - Consider renaming the `shiny_app` folder to something like `iaoreader` or `iaoreader_app`.
