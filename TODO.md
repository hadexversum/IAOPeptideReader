    - **Note**
        - There should be a wrapper for updating plot settings so that multiple updaters (one for each plot setting) can be created easily. 
        - JS should have a separate updater for each setting.
 - [ ] Create the JS plot.
    - [ ] Add div for the plot.
    - [ ] Create canvas.
    - [ ] Ensure that the plot behaves *correctly* when the browser window is resized.
 - [ ] Test interrupting file upload when too many files were selected.
 - [ ] Make the summary table detachable or relocate it so that it can be viewed alongside the plot.
 - [ ] Fixes:
    - [ ] Update `selectInput` in the **Data Preview** tab to work better when there is a file with a long name and the resolution is low (browser is resized).
