 - Update sidebar CSS.
    - Padding or margin so that arrows in selectInputs do not overlap the text.
    - Consider resizing the sidebar.
    - Add minimum resolution tested to the `README.md`.
    - Add styling for maximum sequence length.
 - An icon with GitHub URL of the app's repo.
 - Add titlePanel (with better CSS than the default `titlePanel` has).
 - Create the JS plot.
    - During the plot creation create new inputs in the **Plot Settings** tab for each feature which should be customizable.
    - Add div for the plot.
    - Create canvas.
    - Ensure that the plot behaves *correctly* when the browser window is resized.
 - Test interrupting file upload when too many files were selected.
 - Make the summary table detachable or relocate it so that it can be viewed alongside the plot.
 - Add `shinycssloaders`.
     - **Input Files Summary** (?)
 - Fixes:
    - Update `selectInput` in the **Data Preview** tab to work better when there is a file with a long name and the resolution is low (browser is resized).
    - Update selctInputs in **Input Files Summary** for lower resolutions.
        - Move arrows towards right edge of the input.
        - Assure that the text is not overlapping with the arrow.
    - `white-space` CSS attribute to `p` tags in **Input Files Summary**.
    - Add scroll to the **Input Files Summary** when there are too many files.
 - Nice to haves:
    - Confirmation when resetting the plot settings.
       - Option to disable the reset confirmation for current session.
    - Consider renaming the `shiny_app` folder to something like `iaoreader` or `iaoreader_app`.
    - Warning that (such as sequence length border orange) when after filtering to given seq len yields no pepitdes to plot.
    - Additional sequence length utilities:
        - checkbox to toggle automatic adjustment of sequence length to the displayed data,
        - button to set the max seq len.
